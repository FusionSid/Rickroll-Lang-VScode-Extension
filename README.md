# Rickroll-Lang VSCode Extension

Syntax highlighting and Snippets for the Rickroll-Lang programming language

---

## What is this?

This VS Code extension provides 3 things, Snippets, Syntax Highlighting and Rickroll Commands. It works with rickroll files so to get support for the syntax highlighting use one of the supported file extenstions: `.rickroll`, `.rr`, `.ricklang`, `.rickastley`, `.rick`. You can see an example of the syntax highlighting [bellow](#with-vs-without).

This extenstion also provides snippets for common rickroll-lang keywords or statments. For example if you want to print something you could type the whole print statement out `i just wanna tell you how im feeling` or you could type `rr-print` and it would insert the statement there.  

Lastly the extension provides to commands: `Rickroll` and `Rickroll Me`. Rickroll will open "Never gonna give you up" in your browser wherase Rickroll Me will rickroll you in vscode itself.
