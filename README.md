# Rickroll-Lang VSCode Extension

The Rick Roll programming language is a rickroll based, process oriented, dynamic, strong, esoteric programming language. All of the keywords/statements are from Rick Astley's lyrics.

This vscode extension currently only has some snippets for the language. It has a rickroll command which opens the song in your browser. Also it adds the RickRoll langauge to you list so when you oepn a `.rickroll` file it shows the language as Rickroll-Lang in the bottom

I will add syntax highlighting when i figure out how to do so.
